### Hi there, I'm Zoel 👋

I'm a Systems Engineering student architecting robust and efficient technology with a human-centered approach. I see technology as a bridge between logic and empathy, where the best systems serve both efficiency and humanity. My mission is to operate as an **agent of change**, leveraging complex systems to create measurable, positive outcomes.

### About Me

Currently in my third semester at Tecnológico Superior de Jalisco, I'm building a deep technical foundation in software engineering and IT infrastructure. I approach every challenge with a dual mindset:

* **The Engineer:** Deconstructs complex problems, designs logical systems, and builds resilient solutions from first principles.  
* **The Humanist:** Focuses on the end-user and the broader societal impact of technology, ensuring solutions are not only functional but also responsible and empathetic.  

My primary domains of interest are **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**, as I believe these fields hold the greatest potential for addressing real-world challenges in the coming decade.

### 💡 Core Philosophy

* **Systems Over Goals:** I focus on building sustainable systems for growth and productivity, trusting that good systems inevitably achieve great goals.  
* **Sharing the Journey:** I openly document my learning process, turning personal notes, experiments, and insights into resources that others can learn from.  
* **Resilience Through Refactoring:** I treat setbacks as data points—opportunities to debug, extract lessons, and refactor for stronger outcomes.

### 🚀 Current Work

* **🐍 Python:** Strengthening my foundations and applying them by developing a **User Authentication System**, with secure password hashing and modular design.  
* **📊 Data Analytics:** Preparing to begin the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** in January 2026 to gain professional skills in data interpretation and visualization.  
* **🗣️ English (B2/C1):** Expanding conversational fluency to complement strong technical reading comprehension.  
* **🇮🇹 Italian:** Building a foundational understanding of a third language.
