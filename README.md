# Hi there, I'm Zoel Puente

### Systems Engineering Student | Supply Chain Integrity Specialist

I am a **Computer Systems Engineer** in the making with a distinctive edge: I don't just write code; I operate high-stakes logistics.

Currently, I safeguard a **$50M USD annual asset flow** at Jabil while architecting software solutions to minimize industrial waste and financial loss. My focus is on **Physical-Digital Convergence**: using Data Engineering and Python to solve real-world inefficiencies in Supply Chains.

### Current Focus: Project QuantIA

I am currently architecting **QuantIA**, a SaaS Business Intelligence proposal designed to solve the "Dead Stock Paradox."

* **The Mission:** To transform static inventory data into predictive financial insights.
* **The Goal:** Reduce ESG impact by minimizing waste through better algorithms.
* **The Stack:** Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Business Intelligence.

> *Check out the [QuantIA Architecture Repository](LINK_A_TU_REPO_QUANTIA) to see the roadmap.*

### My Engineering Philosophy

* **Systems > Goals:** Goals are momentary; systems are compounding. I build robust workflows (both in code and in warehouses) that survive friction.
* **The Operator's Mindset:** My code is grounded in reality. I know the cost of a runtime error because I know the cost of a stopped production line.
* **Resilience:** I view failure—systemic or personal—as a dataset to be debugged, not a dead end.
