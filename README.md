### Hi there, I'm Zoel 👋

I'm a Systems Engineering student architecting robust, efficient, and human-centered technology. My mission is to operate as an **agent of change**, leveraging complex systems to create tangible, positive impacts.

---
### About Me

Currently in my third semester at Tecnológico Superior de Jalisco, I'm building a deep technical foundation in software engineering and IT infrastructure. I approach every challenge with a dual mindset:

* **The Engineer:** Who deconstructs complex problems, designs logical systems, and builds resilient solutions from first principles.
* **The Humanist:** Who remains focused on the end-user and the broader societal impact of technology, ensuring that solutions are not only functional but also responsible and empathetic.

My primary domains of interest are **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**, as I believe these fields hold the greatest potential for solving the challenges of the next decade.

### 💡 My Core Philosophy

* **Systems Over Goals:** I focus on building sustainable systems for growth and productivity, believing that good systems inevitably achieve great goals.
* **Learning in Public:** I am committed to documenting my learning journey as a "Digital Garden," transforming personal knowledge into shared, high-value assets.
* **Resilience Through Refactoring:** I view setbacks not as failures, but as data points—opportunities to debug a process, extract a lesson, and refactor for a more robust outcome.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

* **🐍 Python:** Solidifying my foundational knowledge via some courses from my university and applying it by building a **User Authentication System** from scratch.
* **📊 Data Analytics:** Scheduled to begin the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** in January 2026 to build a professional-grade skill stack in data interpretation and visualization.
* **🗣️ English (B2/C1):** Actively improving my conversational fluency to complement my strong technical comprehension.
* **🇮🇹 Italian:** Building a foundational knowledge of my third language.

### 💻 Key Pinned Projects

* **[In Progress] User Authentication System (Python):** A modular and secure backend system implementing cryptography best practices. The goal is to build a reusable and robust authentication core for future applications.
* **[Planned] Full-Featured POS System (Java):** A comprehensive Point of Sale application designed from a professional technical specification, intended to be a capstone project demonstrating my skills in building complex, data-driven desktop applications.
* **[Planned] "Digital Garden" of Knowledge:** The public repository that will host my structured notes, guides, and analyses from my ongoing learning journey.

My long-term vision is to leverage this hybrid technical, strategic, and human-centric skill set to excel in high-impact consulting or executive leadership roles within a global market.

### 💻 My Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, Java, C++, SQL.
* **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite.
* **Developer Tools:** Git, GitHub, PyCharm, Maven, VS Code.
* **Core Interests:** AI/Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Backend Development.
