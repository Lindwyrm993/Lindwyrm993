## About Me

Hello! I'm Diego Zoel Puente Avila, a Computer Systems Engineering student at Tecnol√≥gico Superior de Jalisco, campus Zapopan. Currently in third semester of a nine-semester program.

My passion lies primarily in technology, innovation, and disruptive change. I consider myself an organized and methodical person, both in my learning processes and project development.

My main areas of interest include programming, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data analysis. At the moment, I'm focusing on strengthening my backend development skills as a foundation for becoming a well-rounded **Fullstack Developer**.

I'm currently learning **C#**, **Python** and **Java**, with a strong emphasis on best development practices. I mainly work with development environments such as **NetBeans** and **Visual Studio**, and have recently started using **Jupyter Notebook** as part of my preparation for the "**Accelerating Mexico with Artificial Intelligence 2025**" program by Intel.

I have also completed the **Foundation of ChatGPT** course offered by **Santander Open Academy** as part of my early training in artificial intelligence.

Additionally, I'm learning **Italian** to broaden my cultural and professional horizons.
